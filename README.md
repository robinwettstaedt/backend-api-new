# notedly's (name in progress) backend api

This is the backend to a note taking Progressive Web App (notedly) which I started in order to get to know Node.js, express.js, MongoDB and Next.js with Typescript better.

The idea came from existing apps, such as [notion](https://notion.so/).

## Technologies used

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) as the Javascript Runtime
- [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) for the REST API routes on the backend
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as the Database
